The Network allows you to have an online interface where you can view all of your various social websites or any 
websites that you use frequently(facebook, twitter, yahoo mail, gmail, google+, yahoo stocks etc.)and gives you a
quick overview of your (using facebook as an example) notifications and what they are about, or your messages. If 
you click on that window in the interface, it opens up the full website and you are automatically logged in so you 
only have to ever memorize your one password on our website to always be logged in.
